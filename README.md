# ufw-cidr-autoblock
This tool automatically creates and applies firewall block rules based CIDR lists (GEO-IP block)

Currently only IPv4 CIDR blocks are implemented.

## Credits
Many thanks go out to http://ipverse.net who provide address block lists aggregated by country.

## ToDo
* Implement IPv6
