# Archived bash scripts

The GO code from this project is based on the workflow within these bashscripts.

These scripts have served me well for years, but I don't pretend this is how bash
should look :-)

It was one of the first bash scripts I ever wrote and have never took the time to
rework the code into more proper bash.
